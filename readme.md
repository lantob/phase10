# Phase 10 adoption in Python

This is written solely as a project in order to learn python programming and does not intent to be used commercially by any means. The games itself surely is licenced and this should not be seen as a competitor or right infringment.

## Current status:
- deck works as intended
- players can draw cards and play basic phases

## Not yet implemented:
- appending a card to an existing phase
- winning a round
